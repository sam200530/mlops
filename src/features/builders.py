"""Stateless feature builders.

Every function here is *stateless and causal*: its output for a row depends only
on that row (or on strictly earlier rows). Nothing learns a statistic from the
data, so these can be applied to the whole frame before splitting without
leaking — there is no fitted quantity that could carry information from
validation or holdout back into training.

Stateful transformations (frequency maps, entity aggregates) live in
:mod:`src.features.aggregations` and are fit on the training partition only.

Each feature carries a short note on *why* it should help. Features without a
mechanism are not added.

    No true account id exists in this dataset. ``card1`` (0% missing) combined

    for per-entity history. These are *keys*, not model inputs — the velocity and
    aggregation layers consume them, then the pipeline drops them.

    The keys are built as **deterministic integer arithmetic** rather than
    concatenated strings or factorized codes, for two reasons:

    * Memory: three string columns over 590,540 rows cost hundreds of MB;
      int64 costs 4.7 MB each.
    * Correctness: partitions are prepared separately, and ``factorize`` codes
      are assigned per-call, so the same card would get different codes in the
      training and holdout files. Arithmetic on the raw values is stable
      everywhere, including at serving time for a single transaction.

    Collision-freedom depends only on the two *low-order* components staying
    inside their positional slots: ``addr1`` and ``card2`` must each be < 1000.
    ``card1`` occupies the high-order slot, so its magnitude is irrelevant to
    uniqueness and is bounded only by int64 overflow.

    That distinction was learned the hard way. An earlier version also asserted
    ``card1 <= 18396`` — its maximum in *train* — and the build failed on the test
    split, where ``card1`` reaches 18,397. The assertion was over-strict rather
    than the data being wrong: one extra card id cannot cause a collision. The
    check now constrains exactly what correctness requires, which is also why the
    fix needed no retraining — every previously computed key is unchanged.

    Measured ranges: ``card1`` ∈ [1000, 18397], ``addr1`` ∈ [100, 540],
    ``card2`` ∈ [100, 600] across both train and test. Missing values map to 0,
