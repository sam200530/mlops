"""Hyperparameter optimisation with Optuna.

Scope is deliberately bounded. Only LightGBM — the production candidate — is
tuned; spending compute tuning baselines whose job is to be a reference point
would not change any decision. The budget is capped by both trial count and
wall-clock timeout, and each trial is scored on a **subset of the later temporal
folds** rather than all of them: the early folds train on as little as 134k rows
and are the least representative of the deployed model's situation, so tuning
against them would optimise for the wrong regime.

The objective is mean PR-AUC across those folds. The holdout is never involved —
it is not read once during tuning.
