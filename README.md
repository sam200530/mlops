# Leakage-Safe Fraud Detection Platform

[![CI](https://github.com/sam200530/mlops/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sam200530/mlops/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A fraud detection system on the [IEEE-CIS](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection)
dataset, built around one question: **how do you know your validation number is real?**

The answer, measured in this repository:

> Random stratified 5-fold cross-validation scored **0.8512 PR-AUC**.
> Purged forward-chaining temporal CV — same model, same data, same code — scored
> **0.5583**.
>
> The random estimate was inflated by **+0.2929 (52% relative)** and reported a
> **five times smaller** standard deviation while doing it. It looked more
> trustworthy exactly where it was more wrong.

Everything else here exists to make that finding trustworthy and to ship the
resulting model.

> **Every number below was produced by code in this repository.** Model metrics
> from `scripts/train.py` (also in `reports/model_comparison.csv` and MLflow);
> dataset facts from `scripts/inspect_dataset.py`; drift figures from
> `scripts/monitor.py`. Where something was not executed, it says so.

## Problem

Given a card-not-present transaction, return a calibrated fraud probability fast
enough to sit inside an authorisation flow, plus the reasons behind it.

The binding constraint is **cost asymmetry**, not accuracy. Missing fraud means a
chargeback; flagging a legitimate customer means a declined sale. At 3.4993%
prevalence there are 27.58 legitimate transactions per fraudulent one, so even a
small false-positive *rate* produces an alert queue no review team can clear. The
system therefore optimises **ranking quality at low alert volume** and
**calibrated probabilities**.

Three properties of fraud shaped every decision:

- **Extreme imbalance.** Predicting "never fraud" scores **96.5007% accuracy**.
  Accuracy cannot separate a useful model from a constant, so it is reported
  nowhere in this project.
- **Non-stationarity.** Measured prevalence moves between **2.4762% and 4.1795%**
  across 30-day blocks. Validation assuming a fixed distribution measures the
  wrong thing.
- **Delayed labels.** Chargebacks arrive weeks later, so live PR-AUC is not
  observable. Degradation must be caught from input and score *distributions* —
  which is why drift monitoring here is not decoration.

## Dataset

Four CSVs, profiled by `scripts/inspect_dataset.py` (full output:
[`docs/01_dataset_audit.md`](docs/01_dataset_audit.md)):

| file | size | rows | columns | duplicate rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `train_transaction.csv` | 651.7 MB | 590,540 | 394 | 0 |
| `train_identity.csv` | 25.3 MB | 144,233 | 41 | 0 |
| `test_transaction.csv` | 584.8 MB | 506,691 | 393 | 0 |
| `test_identity.csv` | 24.6 MB | 141,907 | 41 | 0 |

**Target:** `isFraud` — 20,663 fraud / 569,877 legitimate = **3.4993%**.

**Column families:** `V1`–`V339` (mean 43.04% missing), `C1`–`C14` (**0%
missing**), `D1`–`D15` (timedeltas, 58.15% mean missing), `M1`–`M9`,
`card1`–`card6`, `addr1/2`, `dist1/2`, email domains, identity block.

### Three audit findings that changed the design

**1. The Kaggle test set is unlabeled** — 393 columns to train's 394, the only
difference being `isFraud`. No metric can be computed on it, so the final holdout
is carved from the *training* period by time, and the test files serve only as an
unlabeled distribution for drift analysis.

**2. Identity covers only 24.42% of train rows** (28.01% of test), strictly 1:1.
An inner join would discard 75.6% of the data, and since coverage itself differs
between periods it would bias the sample too. `LEFT JOIN`, with
`identity_present` promoted to a feature.

**3. `test_identity.csv` uses `id-01`…`id-38`; train uses `id_01`…`id_38`.** All
38 names differ. Unfixed, a model trained on one and scored on the other sees 38
all-null columns and **degrades silently instead of crashing**. Renamed once at
the load boundary, then asserted absent.

## Why Random CV Was Misleading

Three measured facts make random K-fold invalid here:

| fact | measurement |
|---|---|
| Train and test are disjoint in time | train days 1–183, test days 213–396, gap **exactly 30.0 days**, **0** shared timestamps |
| Prevalence is non-stationary | 2.4762% → 4.0373% → 4.0319% → 3.9265% → 3.4723% → 3.4013% → 4.1795% per 30-day block |
| Entities recur | the same card transacts repeatedly, so random folds train and validate on the same entity |

Deployment is **forward extrapolation across a gap**. Random CV measures
*interpolation inside a window the model will never operate in*.

So it was measured rather than asserted (`scripts/train.py --random-cv-control`):

| CV scheme | PR-AUC | ROC-AUC | P@top 1% | std dev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Random stratified 5-fold | **0.8512** | 0.9657 | 0.9975 | ± 0.0044 |
| Purged forward-chaining 5-fold | **0.5583** | 0.8838 | 0.9268 | ± 0.0225 |
| **Optimism** | **+0.2929** | +0.0819 | +0.0707 | — |

The holdout scored **0.5639** under this configuration — within one standard
deviation of the temporal estimate and nowhere near the random one. That is the
practical confirmation that the temporal scheme was the honest choice.

Both arms of this experiment ran on the same 530-feature set, so the comparison is
internally consistent and stands unchanged. The **shipped** model now excludes the
15 `D*_anchored` features and scores 0.5468 CV / 0.5279 holdout — see
[Final Model](#final-model).

Logged to MLflow as `random_cv_optimism_pr_auc`.

## Temporal Validation

A chronological split was **verified feasible before adoption**
(`src/data/validation.py::validate_temporal_order`, asserted on every load):

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `TransactionDT` nulls / negatives | 0 / 0 |
| Already monotonic in raw file order | yes |
| `corr(TransactionID, TransactionDT)` | 0.99828 → the ID is a disguised time index, hard-excluded |
| Days covered | 1–182, **182 distinct days, none missing** |
| Largest gap between timestamps | 4,138 s (1.15 h) |
| Rows sharing a timestamp | 33,932 (**5.746%**), max 8 |
| Rows exactly on the 80th-percentile cut | **0** |

Ties matter: boundaries snap to timestamp edges so a tie group is never split
across partitions, and `_assert_disjoint_in_time` verifies no timestamp appears in
two partitions.

**Three-way split** (`data/processed/split_metadata.json`):

| partition | rows | days | fraud rate | role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| train | 377,945 | 1–109 | 3.4119% | model fitting |
| validation | 94,487 | 109–141 | 3.9201% | threshold + calibration |
| **holdout** | **118,108** | **141–182** | **3.4409%** | **scored once, at the end** |

**Purged forward-chaining folds** over the modelling period: each trains on the
past and validates on the next contiguous block, with a **7-day purge gap** — at
least as wide as the longest velocity look-back (168 h), because otherwise a
trailing aggregate computed at the start of a validation block reaches back into
training rows even though the *rows* are separated.

**In one sentence: fold N trains on days 1 to X, waits 7 days, then validates on
days X+7 onward. Nothing is shuffled, no validation row precedes any training row
in time, and the training window only ever grows forward.**

```
day  1                                                                   141
     |------------------------------------------------------------------|
f0   [train 1-12.8 ]<-7d->[ val 19.8-37.9 ]
f1   [train 1-30.9        ]<-7d->[ val 37.9-64.7 ]
f2   [train 1-57.7               ]<-7d->[ val 64.7-90.8 ]
f3   [train 1-83.8                      ]<-7d->[ val 90.8-114.6 ]
f4   [train 1-107.6                            ]<-7d->[ val 114.6-141.1 ]
```

| fold | train rows | train days | val rows | val days | purge gap | overlap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 46,274 | 1.0 – 12.8 | 78,739 | 19.8 – 37.9 | **7.0 d** | none |
| 1 | 133,979 | 1.0 – 30.9 | 78,739 | 37.9 – 64.7 | **7.0 d** | none |
| 2 | 214,078 | 1.0 – 57.7 | 78,738 | 64.7 – 90.8 | **7.0 d** | none |
| 3 | 293,305 | 1.0 – 83.8 | 78,739 | 90.8 – 114.6 | **7.0 d** | none |
| 4 | 372,880 | 1.0 – 107.6 | 78,739 | 114.6 – 141.1 | **7.0 d** | none |

Boundaries are read back off the persisted folds rather than asserted from the
code that wrote them. Four properties hold on every fold, and all four are
verified rather than claimed:

| property | result |
|---|---|
| Every validation start > every train end | **True** |
| Train / validation index overlap | **none** |
| Rows time-ordered within each training window | **True** |
| Training windows expand monotonically | 46,274 → 133,979 → 214,078 → 293,305 → 372,880 |

How the boundary is enforced: folds are cut on **timestamp edges**, persisted once
to `data/processed/folds_temporal.npz`, and reused byte-identically by every model,
so no model can be scored on a different split. `_assert_disjoint_in_time` fails the
run if a timestamp appears in two partitions, and the 7-day purge is applied by
*index position*, not by sampling — there is no shuffle anywhere in the path.

Validation fraud rate exceeds training fraud rate in *every* fold — a structural
property random folds would average away.

## Leakage-Safe Feature Engineering

The pipeline has a three-phase shape, and **the shape is the leakage control**
(`src/features/pipeline.py`):

| phase | what it does | safe on the full frame? |
|---|---|---|
| `prepare(df)` | row-local transforms + past-only velocity | **yes** — nothing fitted, nothing reads a future row |
| `fit(train_df)` | learns frequency counts, per-entity baselines, categorical vocabularies | **training partition only** |
| `transform(df)` | pure lookup | applied identically to validation, holdout, serving |

The only method that learns anything takes the training frame as its argument, so
fitting an encoder on validation data is structurally impossible rather than
merely discouraged.

**Encoders are refitted inside every CV fold** (`src/models/training.py::_fit_one`).
Frequency counts and per-entity means are *population statistics*; fitting them
once on the whole modelling period and then cross-validating would leak each
fold's validation rows into its own training features.

| family | features | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Amount | `log_amount`, `amount_cents`, `is_round_amount` | Right-skewed (mean 135.03, max 31,937). Class means are close (149.24 vs 134.51), so absolute amount is weak — the decimal part fingerprints card testing and currency conversion. |
| Per-entity amount | `*_amt_mean_hist`, `*_amt_diff_from_mean`, `*_amt_zscore` | Fraud is anomalous *for that account*, not absolutely. |
| Velocity | `*_txn_count_{1,24,168}h`, `*_amt_sum_*`, `*_seconds_since_prev` | Card testing and ATO are burst behaviours invisible in one transaction. |
| Time (cyclical) | `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `is_night`, `is_weekend` | Fraud rate peaks where volume troughs — automation at off-peak hours. Cyclical, so it transfers across the 30-day gap. |
| Email | provider/TLD split, `email_domains_match` | Purchaser/recipient mismatch is a classic mule indicator. |
| Device | `device_vendor`, `os_family`, `browser_*`, screen dims | `DeviceInfo` has >1,000 distinct values and would overfit verbatim. |
| Missingness | `n_missing_total`, per-family counts, `identity_present` | Missingness is structural, not random, and correlates with fraud. |
| Frequency encoding | `card1_freq`, `card2_freq`, `addr1_freq`, … | Rare identifiers are disproportionately fraudulent; uses no label, so it cannot leak the target. |

**Velocity is causal, not leakage.** Each value uses only rows *strictly earlier
in time*, which at inference have already happened; the current row is excluded by
construction. Four tests in `tests/test_features.py::TestVelocityIsCausal` assert
this, including that five sequential transactions produce counts `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

**One deliberate score sacrifice.** Fitting frequency encodings on train ∪ test is
a well-known Kaggle booster and it is **transductive leakage** — it assumes the
scoring population is known at training time, which a live API cannot. Counts come
from the training partition only. This costs leaderboard points and is right for a
serving system.

**Hard exclusions:** `isFraud`; `TransactionID` (corr 0.998 with time); raw
`TransactionDT` (disjoint ranges, so a tree routes every test row to one leaf);
`V107` (constant in test, not train).

## Model Comparison

Models are compared on **identical persisted folds**, from a full run
(`python scripts/train.py --random-cv-control`). Every figure below is retained in
MLflow; `reports/model_comparison.csv` is regenerated on each run and therefore
reflects whatever was executed last, so the table here is the canonical record.

> **This table compares model *classes* on the 530-feature configuration**, with
> every model on identical folds — so the ranking is valid and internally
> consistent. The **shipped** model is untuned LightGBM on 515 features
> (0.5468 ± 0.0120 CV), after `D*_anchored` was removed; see
> [Final Model](#final-model). Only LightGBM was rerun on the new feature set, as
> the removal decision concerns the shipped model rather than which algorithm wins.

| model | CV PR-AUC | lift | ROC-AUC | precision | recall | F1 | Brier | P@top 1% | train time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LightGBM (tuned)** | **0.5754 ± 0.0239** | **15.91×** | 0.8967 | 0.6684 | 0.4862 | 0.5616 | 0.0227 | 0.9238 | 2960.6 s |
| LightGBM (baseline) | 0.5583 ± 0.0225 | 15.45× | 0.8838 | 0.6766 | 0.4692 | 0.5533 | 0.0236 | 0.9268 | 638.9 s |
| XGBoost | 0.5370 ± 0.0211 | 14.83× | 0.8754 | 0.6675 | 0.4515 | 0.5381 | 0.0242 | 0.9172 | 1579.6 s |
| Random Forest | 0.4677 ± 0.0404 | 12.82× | 0.8819 | 0.5415 | 0.4049 | 0.4604 | 0.0966 | 0.8295 | 185.1 s |
| Logistic Regression | 0.3560 ± 0.0703 | 9.62× | 0.8328 | 0.4462 | 0.3661 | 0.4018 | 0.1400 | 0.7151 | 115.0 s |

**Boosting is measured to be better, not assumed** — untuned LightGBM beats Random
Forest by +0.091 PR-AUC and Logistic Regression by +0.202.

**XGBoost was run and lost.** It was given a search space mirrored to LightGBM's,
the same native categorical handling, the same folds and the same early-stopping
rule, so the comparison reflects the algorithms rather than the setup. It came in
0.021 PR-AUC lower at 2.1× the training cost, winning 1 of 5 folds (fold 3). The
margin is comparable to the fold-to-fold spread (±0.021), so this is a consistent
but modest loss, not a decisive one — the 4-of-5 fold record is what makes it
credible, not the mean alone. It is reported rather than dropped: a comparison in
which the challenger always wins would say nothing about the methodology.

**ROC-AUC hides most of that gap.** Random Forest reaches 0.8819 against untuned
LightGBM's 0.8838 — a **0.002** difference — while the PR-AUC gap is **0.091**,
roughly fifty times larger. With ~570k negatives in the FPR denominator, ROC-AUC
barely registers the false-positive volume separating these models. Selecting on
ROC-AUC would have called them equivalent. This is the in-repo demonstration of
why PR-AUC is the selection metric at 3.5% prevalence.

**Stability tracks capability.** PR-AUC standard deviation runs 0.0225 → 0.0211 →
0.0404 → 0.0703 down the untuned table. Logistic Regression is not merely worse on
average, it is ~3× more volatile across time periods.

**Calibration separates the tree models further:** Brier 0.0236 (LightGBM) vs
0.0966 (RF) vs 0.1400 (LogReg) — RF is 4× worse calibrated than LightGBM despite
near-identical ROC-AUC. This matters because the API serves probabilities, not
only rankings.

### The row-count confound, measured rather than waved away

Logistic Regression and Random Forest are fitted on **100,000 rows** (all
positives kept, negatives downsampled) because their one-hot matrices are 929
features wide; LightGBM and XGBoost use every row with 530 native features. That
is a genuine confound — the baselines could be losing on data volume rather than
on model class.

Rather than argue about it, the boosters were rerun **at the baselines' row
count** (`--force-subsample 100000`, same folds, same seed):

| fold | LightGBM full | LightGBM @100k | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.5338 | 0.5338 | 0.0000 |
| 1 | 0.5473 | 0.5484 | +0.0011 |
| 2 | 0.5683 | 0.5586 | −0.0097 |
| 3 | 0.5448 | 0.5567 | +0.0119 |
| 4 | 0.5973 | 0.5805 | −0.0168 |
| **mean** | **0.5583** | **0.5556** | **−0.0027** |

At equal data, LightGBM scores **0.5556** against Random Forest's 0.4677 and
Logistic Regression's 0.3560:

| comparison | value |
|---|---|
| Cost of subsampling to LightGBM | **0.0027** |
| LightGBM margin over Random Forest | **0.0879** (**33× larger**) |
| LightGBM margin over Logistic Regression | **0.1996** (74× larger) |

**The ranking is not an artefact of training-set size.** Fold 0 is identical in
both columns because its training window holds 46,274 rows — below the cap — which
confirms the flag does nothing when it should do nothing.

Why not simply fit the baselines on all 472k rows with a sparse matrix? Because
sparse is *worse* here. After median-fill the 492 numeric columns have almost no
zeros, so CSR pays 8 bytes per nonzero (4-byte value + 4-byte index) where dense
pays 4: **1.98 GB sparse against 1.62 GB dense.** Sparse storage only wins when
the numeric block itself is sparse; here only the 430-column one-hot block is.
The honest fix is more RAM or an out-of-core solver, not a storage change — and
the equal-data control above answers the question without needing either. Tuning gained **+0.0171 PR-AUC** from **8 of 25 Optuna trials** in
5964.4 s — the wall-clock cap stopped the search, not convergence, so 0.5754 is a
lightly-searched improvement rather than a converged optimum. Finally, the tuned
model hit the 2,000-round ceiling on 3 of 5 folds, meaning the round cap rather
than the hyperparameters is the binding constraint.

## Final Model

**LightGBM**, **untuned**, isotonic-calibrated, trained on all 472,432 modelling
rows with **515 features** — the 15 `D*_anchored` features are excluded.

### Why they were removed

They anchor to **absolute** time (`D_n_anchored = day_index − D_n`). Training
covers days 1–182; deployment sits at days 213–396. All 15 drift completely
against that period — KS up to **1.000**, distributions with no overlap — while
the raw `D` columns they derive from stay stable (`D1` KS 0.041).

An [ablation](#drift-monitoring) measured them at **+0.0115 PR-AUC in-period**.
That is not a gain to protect; it is the size of the trap. Every CV fold and the
holdout validate *inside or adjacent to* the training period, where an
absolute-time anchor still lines up. Keeping a feature already proven to fail
under the exact shift the model will face is a defect, not a trade-off.

`anchor_d_columns` remains `true`, so the features are still computed and the
drift report keeps measuring them. Removing their computation would destroy the
evidence that justified excluding them.

### What removal cost, and what it bought

| | 530 features (tuned) | 515 features (untuned) |
|---|---|---|
| CV PR-AUC | 0.5583 ± 0.0251 *(untuned)* | **0.5468 ± 0.0120** |
| Holdout PR-AUC | 0.5639 [0.5488, 0.5786] | **0.5279 [0.5126, 0.5433]** |
| Holdout ROC-AUC | 0.9117 | 0.9021 |
| **Prediction drift PSI** | 0.0329 | **0.0100** |

Read honestly, three things are true at once:

**The holdout got worse, and the intervals do not overlap.** 0.5279 against 0.5639
is a real, statistically significant drop, not noise. Two causes contribute and
they are not separable from these runs alone: the new model is **untuned** (tuning
was worth +0.0171 on the old feature set), and it lost features that genuinely
help in-period.

**The holdout cannot show the benefit.** It covers days 141–182 — immediately
adjacent to training. That is precisely the regime where an absolute-time anchor
still works. The holdout therefore *understates* the case for removal by
construction, and the drop should be read as the expected cost of giving up an
in-period crutch, not as evidence the decision was wrong.

**The one forward-looking signal available improved 3.3×.** Prediction-drift PSI
against the true test period fell from 0.0329 to **0.0100**. The model's output
distribution is now markedly more stable against the period it would actually be
deployed on — measurable without test labels, and the closest thing to direct
evidence the removal worked.

**Fold-to-fold spread also halved** (± 0.0251 → ± 0.0120): the model is less
sensitive to which time period it is evaluated on.

### Not yet done

Hyperparameters were **not** re-searched for the 515-feature model. The previous
values were tuned on a 530-feature space that no longer exists, so reusing them
would make any result unattributable between the feature change and mismatched
settings. Retuning is expected to recover roughly +0.017 based on the earlier
search, and is blocked only by memory on this machine — Optuna refits the two
largest folds repeatedly in one process. See [Limitations](#limitations).

Previous hyperparameters, for reference: `learning_rate` 0.0165, `num_leaves` 240,
`min_child_samples` 162, `feature_fraction` 0.864, `bagging_fraction` 0.958,
`lambda_l1` 0.246, `lambda_l2` 4.870.



Imbalance is handled by **reweighting, not resampling**. SMOTE would interpolate
between fraud rows across a ~530-column space that is largely categorical and
heavily missing; the interpolants would not be plausible transactions.
`scale_pos_weight` leaves the data honest and only changes the loss — and because
reweighting distorts probabilities, isotonic calibration follows.

The saved artifact bundles **model + feature pipeline + calibrator + threshold**
together, which removes the most common production failure in ML systems: a
preprocessing step drifting out of sync with the model.

## Evaluation

The holdout was scored **exactly once**, using the threshold (0.3083) chosen on
validation and applied unchanged.

| metric | validation (last fold) | **holdout (final)** |
|---|---|---|
| PR-AUC | 0.5498 | **0.5279** |
| PR-AUC lift over prevalence | 14.34× | **15.34×** |
| ROC-AUC | 0.9058 | **0.9021** |
| Precision | 0.6428 | **0.7430** |
| Recall | 0.4853 | **0.3905** |
| F1 | 0.5530 | **0.5119** |
| Brier | 0.0232 | **0.0225** |
| Precision @ top 0.1% | — | **0.8814** |
| Precision @ top 1% | 0.9034 | **0.8806** |
| Recall @ top 1% | — | **0.2559** |
| Rows | 78,739 | 118,108 |

**Confusion matrix** at threshold 0.3083 (prevalence 3.4409%):

|  | predicted legit | predicted fraud |
|---|---|---|
| **actually legit** | 113,495 | 549 |
| **actually fraud** | 2,477 | 1,587 |

What this means operationally:

- **PR-AUC 0.5279 is 15.34× the no-skill floor** of 0.0344. The absolute number
  looks unimpressive only if the floor is forgotten.
- **At a 1% alert budget, 88.1% of alerts are genuine fraud**, catching 25.6% of
  all fraud — nearly nine in ten investigations are productive.
- **At the operating point: 549 false positives against 1,587 caught frauds** —
  roughly one false alarm per 2.9 detections, at the cost of missing 2,477. The
  untuned model is markedly more conservative than its predecessor: precision
  rose to 0.743 while recall fell to 0.391. That
  trade is a business choice, which is why the threshold is configuration.
- **Calibration is applied but transfers less well than before**: isotonic cut
  expected calibration error from 0.06201 to 0.00000 on the calibration fold
  (Brier 0.03535 → 0.02325), and holdout Brier 0.0225 still came in *below*
  validation's 0.0232. But holdout ECE is **0.01402**, against 0.00338 for the
  previous model — calibration is fitted on a single fold, and this one
  generalised worse. Worth stating rather than burying: the served probabilities
  are usable but less sharp than the previous configuration's.

**Holdout PR-AUC 0.5279, 95% CI [0.5126, 0.5433]** (SE 0.0079, 2,000 stratified
bootstrap resamples, `bootstrap_metric_ci` in `src/evaluation/metrics.py`).
ROC-AUC 0.9021, 95% CI [0.8965, 0.9077].

The interval sits just below the 5-fold CV mean of 0.5468 and does **not** overlap
the previous 530-feature model's [0.5488, 0.5786] — the drop from removing the
anchored features is real, not sampling noise. See
[Final Model](#final-model) for why the holdout cannot show the offsetting
benefit: it is adjacent in time to training, which is exactly where an
absolute-time anchor still works.

Resampling is stratified within the positive and negative classes so every draw
holds prevalence fixed. Resampling pooled rows would let the fraud rate wander
between draws, and PR-AUC moves with prevalence by construction, which would
inflate the interval with an artefact of the procedure rather than uncertainty
about the model.

**Holdout (0.5279) sits below validation (0.5498) and just below the temporal CV
mean (0.5468 ± 0.0120).** That drop is the expected, honest pattern: validation
informed the threshold and calibration, so it is mildly optimistic; the holdout
was untouched. A holdout scoring *above* validation would be a reason to suspect
the split, not to celebrate.

## SHAP Explainability

`src/explainability/shap_explainer.py`, using `TreeExplainer` — exact for tree
ensembles and needing no background dataset, which is what makes a per-request
explanation viable at all.

| rank | feature | mean \|SHAP\| |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `C13` | 0.4379 |
| 2 | `P_emaildomain` | 0.2083 |
| 3 | `dist1` | 0.1969 |
| 4 | `C1` | 0.1951 |
| 5 | `card1` | 0.1837 |
| 6 | `addr1` | 0.1757 |
| 7 | **`entity_card_amt_mean_hist`** (engineered) | 0.1730 |
| 8 | **`card1_freq`** (engineered) | 0.1729 |
| 9 | `C14` | 0.1727 |
| 10 | `id_31` | 0.1639 |

Recomputed after `D*_anchored` was removed. It previously ranked **3rd**
(0.2640); with it gone the model redistributes onto `P_emaildomain`, `dist1`,
`addr1` and the engineered `card1_freq`, none of which were previously in the top
ten. The redistribution is broad rather than concentrated — no single feature
absorbed the lost attribution, and `C13` itself fell from 0.4902 to 0.4379. That
is the signature of information genuinely available elsewhere rather than a
unique signal being lost, which is consistent with the ablation costing only
0.0115 PR-AUC.

Ten of the top 30 are engineered here. Mean |SHAP| is preferred over LightGBM's
split-count importance because it is in units of model output and is consistent
between the global ranking and the per-transaction explanation the API returns —
the same number explains both.

⚠️ See [Limitations](#limitations) on the `*_anchored` features: their high
ranking is real but does **not** imply they generalise.

## FastAPI

Three routes (`api/routes.py`). The model bundle is loaded **once** at startup and
reused for every request.

| endpoint | purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness plus model provenance: name, trained-at, feature count, calibration status, threshold, holdout metrics. Returns 200 with `status="degraded"` when no model is loaded — "up but modelless" and "down" are different facts. |
| `POST /predict` | Calibrated probability, risk band, threshold, latency, feature-completeness count. |
| `POST /explain` | Prediction plus ranked SHAP contributors (`?top_n=`). |

Provenance is folded into `/health` rather than given a separate `/model-info`
route, and batch scoring was removed — endpoints that exist to look complete are
not endpoints.

**Input contract.** Requiring all ~430 raw columns would make the API unusable, so
the schema names the high-signal fields and accepts the long tail through one
`extra_features` map. Anything omitted becomes NaN — a genuine capability, since
the model is a LightGBM trained on data that is 43% missing across the V block.
`extra="forbid"` catches typo'd fields, validation failures return a structured
422, and a missing model yields 503 rather than 500.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t fraud-api .
```

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v "$(pwd)/models:/app/models:ro" fraud-api
```

Multi-stage build: wheels compile in a builder stage so gcc stays out of the
shipped image; `libgomp1` is installed for LightGBM's OpenMP threading; the
service runs as a non-root user (uid 10001) with a `HEALTHCHECK` on `/health`.

The model artifact is **bind-mounted, not baked in** — otherwise every retrain
forces an image rebuild, and image contents depend on training output. Mounted
read-only, because a service must never modify its own model.

There is no `docker-compose.yml`: with no database or cache to orchestrate, a
single container is the whole system.

## Drift Monitoring

```bash
python scripts/monitor.py --current test
```

> The traffic is not production traffic — this project has no users, and the
> report says so in its own payload. What *is* real is the distribution shift: the
> comparison is the training period against the **real, unlabeled IEEE-CIS test
> period beginning 30 days later**, not a synthetic perturbation.

**PSI** is the trigger (interpretable on a fixed scale, insensitive to sample
size); **KS** is reported alongside (catches shape changes PSI's binning smooths
over, but its p-value goes to zero for any difference once n is large).
Thresholds are stated rather than implied: **< 0.10 stable, 0.10–0.25 moderate,
&gt; 0.25 significant** (`configs/config.yaml`). Bin edges come from the reference
distribution and are reused, since re-binning per window would compare two
different binnings. Per-feature missing-rate deltas fall out of the same pass.

Measured over 507 features, 60,000 rows per period:

| result | value |
|---|---|
| Significantly drifted (PSI > 0.25) | **181** |
| Moderately drifted | 6 |
| Stable | 320 |
| **Prediction drift (model output)** | **PSI 0.0100 — stable** (was 0.0329 with the anchored features) |
| Mean predicted probability | 0.0435 → 0.0312 |

**Heavy input drift, stable output.** The drifted inputs are dominated by device
and identity metadata — `id_31` browser strings (PSI 13.21), `id_30` OS (12.26),
`id_33` resolution (11.92) — which change naturally as browsers and handsets
update over a month. The model does not lean on them enough for its output to
move. Score drift is the only signal available without labels, which is why it is
computed.

### The finding that changed a design decision

Monitoring caught a real defect in this project's **own** feature engineering.

All 15 `D*_anchored` features drift significantly, while the raw `D` columns they
derive from are stable:

| feature | PSI | KS |
|---|---|---|
| `D9_anchored` | 12.447 | **1.000** |
| `D13_anchored` | 5.499 | 0.965 |
| all 15 anchored | 3.5 – 12.4 | 0.84 – 1.00 |
| `D15` (raw) | 0.108 | 0.140 |
| `D1` (raw) | 0.0069 | 0.041 |

A KS statistic of **1.000** means the distributions do not overlap at all.

The cause is my own transformation: `D_n_anchored = day_index − D_n` was meant to
turn a moving delta into a fixed calendar anchor, but `day_index` is **absolute
time**, and the test period sits at days 213–396 against training's 1–182. It
reintroduced through the back door exactly the risk the audit had documented — and
`D1_anchored` ranked 3rd by SHAP in that model, because the holdout is adjacent to
training and hides the problem.

**These features are no longer in the shipped model.** The measurement below is
what justified removing them; see [Final Model](#final-model) for the cost and the
outcome. They are still *computed*, so this drift report keeps measuring them —
deleting the computation would delete the evidence.

### Ablation: what the anchored features are actually worth

The drift finding raised an obvious question — if these features are broken, why
does the model rank them so highly? Removing them and re-measuring answers it.
Run with `scripts/run_ablation.py` against
`configs/config_ablation_no_anchored.yaml`, same folds, same seed, LightGBM:

| fold | 530 features | 515 (no `_anchored`) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.5338 | 0.5335 | −0.0003 |
| 1 | 0.5473 | 0.5575 | +0.0102 |
| 2 | 0.5683 | 0.5496 | −0.0187 |
| 3 | 0.5448 | 0.5350 | −0.0098 |
| 4 | 0.5973 | 0.5583 | **−0.0390** |
| **mean** | **0.5583 ± 0.0251** | **0.5468 ± 0.0120** | **−0.0115 (−2.1%)** |

**Removing them costs 0.0115 PR-AUC in-period, losing 4 of 5 folds.** That is not
a contradiction of the drift result — it is the mechanism behind it. Every CV fold
validates on a slice *inside* the training period, where an absolute-time anchor
still lines up. The features genuinely work there, which is exactly why the model
leans on them and why SHAP ranks `D1_anchored` third.

Two details sharpen the point. The largest loss is **fold 4 (−0.0390)**, the latest
and best-performing fold — the anchor pays most where train and validation are
closest in time. And the ablated model's fold-to-fold spread is **less than half**
the baseline's (± 0.0120 vs ± 0.0251): dropping the features makes performance
markedly more stable across time periods, which is what removing a time-sensitive
crutch looks like.

So the 0.0115 is not a gain to protect — it is the size of the trap. In-period
validation pays for these features; the true test period (days 213–396, KS up to
1.000) would not. This is the clearest example in the project of a feature that
improves every number you can measure before deployment and fails after it.

**Acted on.** They were removed from the shipped configuration and the model
retrained. Holdout PR-AUC fell 0.5639 → 0.5279 exactly as this analysis predicts,
while **prediction-drift PSI against the true test period improved 0.0329 →
0.0100** — a 3.3× reduction, and the only forward-looking evidence obtainable
without test labels.

That a monitoring system built for this project found a genuine flaw in the
project's own features, rather than reporting a reassuring all-clear, is the
strongest evidence that the monitoring is real.

## Testing / CI

```bash
pytest -q
```

**88 tests, all passing.** The suite runs **without the dataset**, on
schema-faithful synthetic fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`) reproducing the real
column families, dtypes, missingness patterns, chronological ordering with ties,
and ~3.5% prevalence with genuine signal. That is deliberate: CI exercises real
code paths — including training a small LightGBM and scoring it through the API —
on a machine with no access to a 1.3 GB Kaggle download.

| file | focus |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_data_validation.py` | schema invariants, temporal split, purged folds, tie handling |
| `tests/test_features.py` | feature builders, **velocity causality**, encoder leakage safety |
| `tests/test_evaluation.py` | metrics, alert budgets, calibration, comparison table |
| `tests/test_monitoring.py` | PSI, KS, drift verdicts |
| `tests/test_api.py` | all three endpoints, invalid input, cold-start velocity, degraded mode |

Several tests exist because they caught real bugs: a nullable-string comparison
that crashed email features; predictions misaligned with request order after the
frame is sorted chronologically; and an over-strict `card1` bound that rejected
the real test split, where `card1` reaches 18,397 against training's 18,396.

**GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `lint → test → docker build → API
smoke test`, green in ~3m 50s. The smoke test starts the image **without a model**
and asserts the container stays up, `/health` reports `degraded`, all three routes
appear in the OpenAPI spec, and `/predict` returns **503** rather than 500.

Note on that last assertion: `/predict` declares `Depends(require_artifact)`, and
FastAPI resolves dependencies *before* validating the request body — so with no
model mounted every call is 503 regardless of payload. The 422 validation path is
covered by `tests/test_api.py`, which runs with a model loaded.

CI earned its place immediately: the first runs surfaced five defects that local
development had hidden — a ruff version pinned inconsistently in three places, a
lint rule that exists in one ruff version and not another, a dependency set that
was **not installable from scratch** (shap 0.52 requires `numpy>=2` against a
`numpy==1.26.4` pin, and scikit-learn 1.2.2 has no CPython 3.12 wheel), a stale
`.dockerignore` entry excluding the very `requirements.txt` the Dockerfile copies,
and a smoke-test assertion based on a wrong assumption about FastAPI's resolution
order.

Every path derives from the repository root via `src/utils/paths.py` (overridable
with `FRAUD_PROJECT_ROOT`, which is how the container points at `/app`). There are
no absolute paths in the codebase.

## How to Run

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12, ~4 GB free RAM for training, ~2 GB disk.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Download the four CSVs from the [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data)
into `data/raw/` (see [`data/README.md`](data/README.md); raw data is gitignored).

```bash
python scripts/inspect_dataset.py
```

```bash
python scripts/build_dataset.py --with-test
```

```bash
python scripts/train.py --random-cv-control
```

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --partition holdout
```

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/docs, or:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"transaction_amt\": 149.99, \"product_cd\": \"W\", \"card1\": 13926, \"card4\": \"visa\", \"p_emaildomain\": \"gmail.com\"}"
```

```bash
python scripts/monitor.py --current test
```

Experiment tracking writes to a local `./mlruns` store; `mlflow ui` shows the runs.
No MLflow server is required.

## Limitations

1. **The shipped model is untuned.** Hyperparameters were not re-searched after
   the feature set changed from 530 to 515 columns. The previous values were
   tuned on a space that no longer exists, so reusing them would make results
   unattributable between the feature change and mismatched settings. Retuning is
   expected to recover roughly +0.017 PR-AUC. It is blocked by memory on the
   development machine, not by code: Optuna refits the two largest folds
   repeatedly in one process, and this machine's commit limit fell from 31.3 GB
   to ~24.5 GB mid-project with `Available MBytes` at 0 under normal desktop
   load. Per-fold isolation (`scripts/run_ablation.py --save-oof`) plus
   `train.py --skip-cv --oof-npz` was added to work around it and is what
   produced the current model; the same approach will complete the search on a
   machine with more headroom.

2. **Removing `D*_anchored` cost measurable holdout performance** — 0.5639 →
   0.5279, with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Part of that is the missing
   tuning above and part is genuine. The holdout cannot show the offsetting
   benefit because it sits adjacent to training, which is exactly where an
   absolute-time anchor still works; prediction-drift PSI improving 3.3× is the
   only forward-looking evidence available without test labels. Stated plainly
   because the headline metric got worse and the decision was still correct.

3. **Velocity features are cold-started at serving time.** The API keeps no
   transaction history, so trailing-window counts are computed from the request
   alone: a single transaction correctly yields 0, meaning "no prior activity known
   to this service". Honest, but weaker than training, where full history was
   available. A production deployment needs a feature store.

4. **No production traffic.** Drift monitoring uses real dataset periods, not live
   users; there is no label feedback loop and no alerting integration.

5. **The Kaggle test set has no labels**, so the final metric is a chronological
   holdout from the training period — an honest near-future estimate, not a
   30-day-forward measurement.

6. **Entity keys are a proxy.** No account identifier exists, so
   `card1 + addr1 + card2` approximates one. Cards sharing those values merge; a
   card whose `addr1` changes splits.

7. **Dense baselines are subsampled** to 100,000 rows, recorded in
   `model_comparison.csv` rather than hidden. The comparison is not perfectly
   equal, and saying so is the point.

8. **The one completed hyperparameter search was itself bounded** — 8 of 25
   Optuna trials under a 5400 s cap, on the previous 530-feature configuration;
   the timeout stopped it, not convergence. It also reached the 2,000-round
   ceiling on 3 of 5 folds, so the round cap — not the hyperparameters — was the
   binding constraint. Any future search should raise both.

9. **Single-node, single-worker.** No horizontal scaling, A/B routing, or shadow
   deployment.

10. **The pinned dependency set differs slightly from the development environment.**
   `requirements.txt` pins `scikit-learn==1.3.2` and `shap==0.46.0`; the reported
   metrics were produced locally under `scikit-learn 1.2.2` and `shap 0.52.0`.
   The development combination is not installable from scratch — shap 0.52
   declares `numpy>=2`, contradicting the `numpy==1.26.4` pin, and scikit-learn
   1.2.2 ships no CPython 3.12 wheel — so it was corrected for reproducibility
   after CI surfaced it. The saved artifact contains exactly one scikit-learn
   object (`IsotonicRegression`, the probability calibrator); loading it under
   1.3.2 is a minor version step and expected to work, but has not been verified
   on this machine.

11. **Docker is verified in CI, not on the development machine.** Docker is not
    installed locally, so the image has never been built here. It *is* built and
    smoke-tested on every push by GitHub Actions — the container starts, `/health`
    reports `degraded` without a mounted model, all three routes appear in the
    OpenAPI spec, and `/predict` returns 503 rather than 500. What remains
    unverified is the image running with a real model artifact mounted, since CI
    has no trained model to mount.

## Future Improvements

Roughly in order of value per unit of effort:

12. **Remove or reformulate `D*_anchored` and retrain.** They measurably harm
   temporal generalisation. Either drop them (the raw `D` columns are stable and
   already present) or re-express the anchor relative to the transaction rather
   than to an absolute day index. The ablation above prices the decision: dropping
   them costs **0.0115 in-period PR-AUC** and halves fold-to-fold variance, so the
   reformulation is the better of the two options — it should recover the signal
   without the absolute-time dependence. The comparison must be rerun, since this
   changes the feature set behind the reported metrics.
13. **A feature store for velocity**, so serving and training share one definition
   and cold starts do not degrade the first requests.
14. **Adversarial validation to prune shift-heavy features** — 181 of 507 already
   drift significantly.
15. **Cost-sensitive thresholding**: minimise expected monetary loss given
   chargeback and review costs, rather than optimising F1, which weights precision
   and recall equally as no fraud team does.
16. **Revisit the 339 V columns on SHAP evidence** — kept deliberately for the
   baseline; correlation-clustering would shrink inference cost if PR-AUC holds.
17. **Scheduled retraining** gated on holdout PR-AUC and drift.
